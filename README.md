# zig-structopt

Another Zig argument parser.

The things I have prioritized are:
- Options being defined as struct fields.
- Configuration (including documentation) being definable alongside the options (instead of needing to be passed in separately).

The main thing that's missing right now is support for subcommands. I haven't added this yet because I haven't needed it, but I may add it at some point. I would also be happy to accept a pull request for this.
